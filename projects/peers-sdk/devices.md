## Key Relationships

### Group ‚Üí Users (1:N)
- Each group can contain multiple users
- Users collaborate within the group context
- Group membership determines access to shared data

### User ‚Üí Devices (1:N)
- Each user can own multiple devices
- Devices provide different interfaces to the same user data
- All devices belonging to a user have access to the user's groups

## Device Types & Use Cases

### Common Device Types
- **üì± Mobile Phones**: Primary communication device, always connected
- **üíª Laptops**: Full-featured interface, development and productivity
- **üñ•Ô∏è Desktops**: Stationary workstation, high-performance tasks
- **üìü Tablets**: Portable consumption and light productivity
- **‚åö Wearables**: Quick notifications and basic interactions

### Device Synchronization
- All devices belonging to a user sync data through the group databases
- Device-specific settings and preferences may be stored locally
- Cross-device continuity allows seamless switching between devices

## Architecture Benefits

### Scalability
- Groups can grow by adding more users
- Users can add more devices without affecting group structure
- Each relationship scales independently

### Flexibility
- Users can participate in multiple groups with the same devices
- New device types can be added without changing core architecture
- Different devices can have specialized interfaces while sharing data
